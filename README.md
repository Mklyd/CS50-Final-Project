# CS50-Final-Project
WSID is a gui application for boring evenings when you do not know what to do. The application will give you the opportunity not to think about what to watch or what to read today if you want to occupy yourself with something new This is also not a problem the application will tell you what to do yourself. All we need to know what to do is to click on two buttons and the program will give the result without any effort 
How does it work?
We have a file which generates our data and after we formulate the data, it is sent to the main application which already generates it for the user. From there you can see how the user sees this data.
When the user enters the applications we see the main screen which has only 3 buttons
